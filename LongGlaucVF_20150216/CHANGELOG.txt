This file contains a description of all changes in the updates of the data
set.

February 16, 2015
    Some observations by Angel de la Llama made us realize that there was a
    problem in the exported, anonymized data, causing a mixup between some
    IDs of the visual fields (in VFPoints.csv). This affected less than 4%
    of the visual fields and has now been corrected.
    Two visual fields were included twice (with the same FIELD_ID).
    Added issue and page information on paper by Erler et al.

March 20, 2014
