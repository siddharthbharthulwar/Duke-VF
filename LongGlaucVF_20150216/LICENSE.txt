Terms of the License
--------------------

1.  The ROI grants User a non exclusive and non transferable license to use
    the Data for research. Transfer of ‘ownership’ of the Data to User is
    neither intended or achieved by this license.
2.  The Data shall be used for research purposes only. User shall respect
    the intention of the ROI to make the Data available as a contribution to
    the scientific commons and use the Data accordingly. Commercial use of
    the Data is not permitted under this License Agreement.
3.  The ROI does not make any representations or extend any warranties of
    any kind, either expressed or implied, in regards to the fitness of Data
    for the intended research or for any other purpose.
4.  The Data are anonymous regarding the Study Participants and are intended
    to remain anonymous. The ROI has taken the necessary precautions to
    secure this anonymity and guarantees that according to the ethical and
    regulatory conditions to which the ROI is subject, the Data can be
    lawfully made available for research under the terms of this license
    agreement.
5.  It is the sole responsibility of User whether User may, under the
    regulatory conditions applicable to User, use the Data for research. The
    ROI cannot be held accountable if User has used the Data for research
    while it has not met all the necessary regulatory requirements
    applicable to User for such use.
6.  To the full extent permitted by applicable law in no event will the ROI
    be liable to the User or any Third Party on any legal theory (including,
    without limitation, negligence) for any loss or damage whatsoever, which
    may result from downloading, using the Data for research, publication of
    the results of the research or any other action which User may perform
    with the Data. If because of any action with the Data, such as, but not
    limited to, transmission, storage, searches on the Data, release of the
    Data or publication of the results of the research, the ROI would be
    held liable to a Third Party, User will indemnify the ROI for any
    damages which may result from this liability, unless it would be
    established that the ROI has acted grossly negligent when making the
    Data available for research through the Portal.
7.  In the context of its research User can combine the Data with other
    data, which User may lawfully use for research. However, User will
    refrain from any activities, such as linking the Data with other data,
    whether publicly available or not, by which the identity of the Study
    Participants could in theory be retrieved.
8.  User maintains policies concerning confidentiality of research data and
    scientific integrity and has taken all necessary administrative,
    technical and physical safeguards to preserve the integrity and
    confidentiality of the Data and to prevent non-permitted or violating
    use or disclosure of the Data.
9.  User may not in any way transfer the Data to a Third Party, without the
    explicit written authorisation of the ROI, unless such transfer would be
    part of the standard procedures for handling data by User, such as
    making use of an ‘applied service provider’, or another ‘processor’ in
    terms of Directive 95/46/EC. It should be contractually secured that the
    previous section applies to this processor correspondingly. If, in the
    context of the research project, data from various sources need to be
    combined at a Third Party, the ROI will not unreasonably withhold this
    authorisation but may state further conditions, such as the extension of
    the conditions of this license agreement to that third party.
10. If, in the context of the research project, User is of the opinion to
    have found Incidental Findings, User shall inform the ROI as soon as
    possible about such findings through the contact address at the portal.
    Given the anonymisation procedures the ROI cannot in any way guarantee
    that such Incidental Findings, even if they would be still relevant for
    the Study Participants concerned, can be linked to those Study
    Participants and be used to alter or improve their treatment. Such
    information about Incidental Findings will nevertheless be valuable
    input for the quality assurance procedures of the ROI.
11. Any information about Incidental Findings will be considered
    confidential information by User and shall not be disclosed to any Third
    Party unless:
    -   This information is already in the public domain, or after the date
        of this License Agreement becomes part of the public domain, other
        than as a result of an unauthorised disclosure by User;  
    -   User is required to disclose this information by a Court order. The
        ROI will be notified as soon as possible about any request of
        competent authorities or others for the confidential information
        which may result in such an order and will be involved in the
        defense against such a request.

12. User can contact the ROI if User needs additional information about the
    Data. The ROI will try to answer such questions insofar as reasonable,
    considering the efforts which the ROI must make in this respect and the
    anonymous nature of the Data. If the questions are more complex, the ROI
    will require a joint research agreement between the ROI and User first
    before any further steps are taken.  
13. The ROI must be acknowledged in all publications, partially or wholly
    based on the Data, by formally citing at least one of the papers that
    are related to the Data. A list of these papers is available from the
    portal. The ROI welcomes a copy of such publications and may add a
    reference to it at the portal.
14. For the avoidance of doubt: the terms of this license agreement apply to
    any employee, intern, co-worker, or any other person which User has
    given access to the Data under the terms of this agreement.
15. The performance of this agreement shall be governed by and shall be
    subject to the law of the Netherlands. Any disputes will be brought
    before the competent Court in the ‘arrondissement’ (district) Rotterdam.
